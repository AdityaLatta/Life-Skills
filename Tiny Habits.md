## Tiny Habits

**What was the most interesting story or idea in this video?**

BJ Fogg, in his video, was of interest with one story: of his friend wanting to build up the habit of flossing. His desire was not to floss all his teeth the first day; he only did one. As a result, the habit had become easy for him to establish. With time, as he got used to the habit, he slowly started flossing all his teeth. This story teaches us how beginning with small, achievable habits can result in larger changes over time.

**How can you apply B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?**

BJ Fogg's B = MAP formula can make starting new habits much easier:

-   **M** stands for Motivation- finding a personal reason that motivates you to start the habit.
-   **A** is for Ability- making the habit simple and easy to do.
-   **P** stands for Prompt-a trigger or reminder that helps you remember to do the habit.

For example, should you want to begin exercising, start with an activity that gets you excited (motivation), doing something relatively less strenuous first, such as a brisk walk (ability), and then do it immediately after doing another habit, say, brushing your teeth (prompt). These three characteristics make habits easier to form.

**Why is it important to "shine" or celebrate after completing a habit?**

It feels good to celebrate after finishing a habit, which makes your brain associate the habit with positive feelings. This will make you more likely to do it again. The more proud or happy you feel after completing a habit, the more enjoyable and rewarding it becomes, which helps strengthen the habit faster.

**What was the most interesting story or idea in this video?**

The most impressive idea of the video is making small improvements day by day that add up over time. Small changes, for example, a better pillow to sleep on or practicing a skill for just a few minutes per day, do not seem much significant in the beginning but may lead to more significant improvements over time. This concept was demonstrated with the story of a cycling team that won the Tour de France by focusing on lots of small, gradual improvements.

The video also highlighted how habits influence our sense of identity. By changing small habits, we can reshape how we view ourselves and what we believe we're capable of achieving.

**What is the book's perspective on identity?**

It tells us that our habits are connected to our identity. The book suggests we should focus on becoming the type of person who would naturally have the habits we want rather than focusing on outcomes.

**What does the book say about making a habit easier to do?**

The book suggests that making a habit easier is to simplify the process. Remove barriers or obstacles that make it harder to start and continue the habit.

**What does the book say about making a habit harder to do?**

To make a habit harder to do, you can introduce barriers or friction that make the process more difficult or less convenient.

**Choose one habit that you'd like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?**

**Habit:** Exercising regularly

-   I can make the cue obvious by placing my workout gear where I can easily see it.
-   I can make the habit enjoyable by listening to my favorite music or by joining a fun class.
-   I will keep the workouts simple by starting short and easy routines.
-   I will track my progress, which will be satisfying, and I will give myself something healthy or relaxing as a reward.

**Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?**

**Habit:** Reducing screen time

-   I can set a specific time to stop using devices each day.
-   I can place my electronic devices on silent.
-   I can utilize apps that would limit my screen time.
-   I can make my screen less attractive by turning it into grayscale.
